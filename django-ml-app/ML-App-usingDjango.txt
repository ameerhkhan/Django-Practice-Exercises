We are using djangoML conda virtual environment for this job.

Execute the following in the virtual env.

    > pip install -U scikit-learn
    > pip install django
    > pip install --upgrade pandas

    > django-admin startproject iris_model

    # Check if creation was successfull,
    > python manage.py runserver

    # Create new app for Prediction
    > python manage.py startapp predictor

Make a separate file in a separate folder which does all the Machine Learning and stuff.

Save your machine learning model using pickle or joblib or something similar.
get those saved files into the main project/app

Import a getPredictions function which uses the saved pickle file to predict answers..

Now make the templates.
